**Enhancing Car Categorization with YOLOv8: Mitigating Overfitting for Improved Generalization**<br>
The project focuses on refining the categorization of cars using the YOLOv8 algorithm. This research addresses critical concerns related to overfitting, ensuring that the model's proficiency extends beyond the confines of the training data. The achieved accuracy of 91.44% signifies the model's capability in precisely classifying four distinct car categories: Audi, Mahindra Scorpio, Swift, and Tata Safari. This research contributes significantly to computer vision and object detection, with broad implications for applications in autonomous driving, traffic monitoring, and surveillance systems.
